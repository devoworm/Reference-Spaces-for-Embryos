This repository will feature a mapping between developmental cell lineages, terminally-differentiated cells, and the adult phenotype.

* the file "Developmental Cells to Neuronal Cells.csv" features a table that aligns developmental cell lineages, terminally-differentiated cells, and potential functional identities (annotations). Cell positions along each axis given as z-scores. Axes: x (anterior-posterior), y (left-right), z (dorsal-ventral).
