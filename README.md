# Reference-Spaces-for-Embryos  

Spatial and annotation schemes for embryos and transition between the the embryo, juvenile, and adult stages. Related repos include the following:  
  
### Embryo Space:
  The embryo space is a 3-D visualization of cell centorids in a 3-D space, registered along 3 anatomical axes (Anterior-Posterior, Left-Right, and Dorsal-Ventral). Each axis is anchored at the midpoint of the positional distribution. Typically, we use arbitrary units (AU - sometimes refered to as embryo units) derived from either direct measurements or eigenvectors.
